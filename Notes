Creating Jar with Intellij IDEA 2017.3 â€“ no main manifest attribute, in .jar 1

Recently we tried to create a Jar file from IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3 using Maven.

After building the artifact, we got the error no main manifest attribute, in $FILE.jar while executing the jar file created by IntelliJ.
After extracting the jar we observed that there was a manifest file but not the one that was specified while creating the artifact.

After some serious google-fu, we got to the following bug ticket.
Apparently, IntelliJ does not read the manifest file that is located in the src/main/java folder!
Working Solution: As suggested in the ticket, we moved the META-INF folder to src/main/resources and rebuild the artifact.
